In the Career Center presentation, I learned about the significance of asking employers open-ended questions during interviews or networking events.
This approach not only helps me gather valuable information but also leave a positive impression on employers as a proactive and thoughtful candidate.
This approach also helps me stand out from the crowd and be memorable to the employers. A firm handshake and dressing for the occaision also helps.
By asking open-ended questions, I can demonstrate my interest in the company or role and gain deeper insights into their values, culture, and expectations. 
Moving forward, I aim to refine my speaking skills to engage employers in meaningful conversations that show my curiosity, critical thinking, and potential contributions to their organization.
